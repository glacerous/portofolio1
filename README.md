```

or

- Run development server to be accessible from other devices (like phones):

## Linting and Formatting

This project uses ESLint, Prettier, and Prettier for TailwindCSS for linting and formatting. Please install the respective plugins for your code editor.

- Run ESLint:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

If there are any errors, you can try to fix them automatically by running:

```bash
$ npm run lint -- --fix
```

- Run Prettier and Prettier for TailwindCSS (just for src):

```bash
$ npx prettier --check src
```

If there are any errors, you can try to fix them automatically by running:

```bash
$ npx prettier --write src
```

**_Don't forget to run them before pushing your code._**
